"Note ID",Note
1,"In general, for police-reported incidents that involve violations against the person, a victim record is collected for each victim involved in the incident. If an individual is a victim in multiple incidents in the same reference year, that individual will be counted as one victim for each incident. Some victims experience violence over a period of time, sometimes years, all of which may be considered by the police to be part of one continuous incident and are counted as a single victim. Victim records are not required for all violent violations, but are accepted, for some violent offences such as uttering threats and criminal harassment."
2,"Data are from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR2) Trend Database, which contains historical data that permit the analysis of trends since 2009 in the characteristics of incidents, and accused and victim characteristics, such as age, gender and accused–victim relationship. This database includes respondents accounting for 99% of the population of Canada."
3,"Rates are calculated on the basis of 100,000 population in each age and gender group unless otherwise noted for specific relationships. Populations based on July 1 estimates from Statistics Canada, Centre for Demography. Rates for victims with unknown age or unknown gender are not available for any reference period, as population estimates cannot be applied to calculate rates where these elements are unknown."
4,"The option for police to code victims as non-binary in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey was implemented in 2018. Given that small counts of victims identified as “non-binary” may exist, the UCR aggregate data available to the public have been recoded to assign these counts to either “male” or “female,” in order to ensure the protection of confidentiality and privacy. Victims identified as non-binary have been assigned to either male or female based on the regional distribution of victims’ gender."
5,"Victim age is calculated based on the end date of an incident, as reported by the police. Some victims experience violence over a period of time, sometimes years, all of which may be considered by the police to be part of one continuous incident."
6,"The category “age of victim unknown” includes victims whose ages were reported as 80 years and older, but were identified as possible instances of miscoding, as well as victims in Quebec whose ages were unknown but were miscoded as 0."
7,"Includes victims aged 15 years and older who were victimized by current and former legally married spouses and common-law partners. Also includes victims aged 12 years and older of current and former boyfriends and girlfriends and other intimate relationships (i.e., those with whom they had a sexual relationship but for which none of the other relationship categories apply). Spousal violence victims under the age of 15 years are included in the relationship category “other family.” Victims of non-spousal intimate partner violence under the age of 12 years are included in the relationship category “unknown relationship.” Rates for total victims are based on populations aged 12 years and older. Rates for other victim age groups are calculated on the basis of their corresponding age group populations."
8,"Excludes data for the Saint John Municipal Police Service (SJPS). In 2016, the decision was taken by the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics in communication with the Saint John Police Service, to remove all microdata records from the microdata trend file which begins in 2009, due to data quality concerns."
9,"Not available. In 2016, the decision was taken by the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics in communication with the Saint John Police Service, to remove all microdata records from the microdata trend file which begins in 2009, due to data quality concerns."
10,"A census metropolitan area (CMA) consists of one or more neighbouring municipalities situated around a major urban core. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000, of which 50,000 or more live in the urban core. To be included in the CMA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the central urban core, as measured by commuting flows derived from census data. A CMA typically comprises more than one police service. CMA populations have been adjusted to follow policing boundaries. The Oshawa CMA is excluded from this analysis owing to the incongruity between the police service jurisdictional boundaries and the CMA boundaries. Belleville–Quinte West (formerly known as Belleville) and Lethbridge became CMAs as of the 2016 Census. Fredericton, Drummondville, Red Deer, Kamloops, Chilliwack and Nanaimo became CMAs as of the 2021 Census. Coverage for each CMA was virtually 100%, except in Toronto (approximately 90%) and Hamilton (approximately 76%). As a result, counts and rates may differ from information from other sources."
11,"Excludes the portions of Halton Regional Police Service and Durham Regional Police Service that police the Toronto census metropolitan area. As a result, counts and rates may differ from information from other sources."
12,"Excludes the portion of Halton Regional Police Service that polices the Hamilton census metropolitan area. As a result, counts and rates may differ from information from other sources."
13,"Fredericton, Drummondville, Red Deer, Kamloops, Chilliwack and Nanaimo became census metropolitan areas as of the 2021 Census."
