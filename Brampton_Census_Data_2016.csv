42, Economic family after-tax income decile group - The economic family income decile group provides a rough ranking of the economic situation of a person based on his or her relative position in the Canadian distribution of the adjusted after-tax income of economic families for all persons in private households.
,Using data from the 2016 Census of Population  the population in private households is sorted according to its adjusted after-tax family income and then divided into 10 equal groups each containing 10% of the population. The decile cut-points are the levels of adjusted after-tax family income that define the 10 groups.
,For the 2016 Census  the reference period is the calendar year 2015 for all income variables.
43, Low-income status - The income situation of the statistical unit in relation to a specific low-income line in a reference year. Statistical units with income that is below the low-income line are considered to be in low income.
,For the 2016 Census  the reference period is the calendar year 2015 for all income variables.
,The low-income concepts are not applied in the territories and in certain areas based on census subdivision type (such as Indian reserves). The existence of substantial in-kind transfers (such as subsidized housing and First Nations band housing) and sizeable barter economies or consumption from own production (such as product from hunting  farming or fishing) could make the interpretation of low-income statistics more difficult in these situations.
,Low-income measure  after tax (LIM-AT) - The Low-income measure  after tax  refers to a fixed percentage (50%) of median-adjusted after-tax income of private households. The household after-tax income is adjusted by an equivalence scale to take economies of scale into account. This adjustment for different household sizes reflects the fact that a household's needs increase  but at a decreasing rate  as the number of members increases.
,Using data from the 2016 Census of Population  the line applicable to a household is defined as half the Canadian median of the adjusted household after-tax income multiplied by the square root of household size. The median is determined based on all persons in private households where low-income concepts are applicable. Thresholds for specific household sizes are presented in Table 4.2 Low-income measures thresholds (LIM-AT and LIM-BT) for private households of Canada  2015  Dictionary  Census of Population  2016.
,When the unadjusted after-tax income of household pertaining to a person falls below the threshold applicable to the person based on household size  the person is considered to be in low income according to LIM-AT. Since the LIM-AT threshold and household income are unique within each household  low-income status based on LIM-AT can also be reported for households.
,Low-income cut-offs  after tax (LICO-AT) - The Low-income cut-offs  after tax refers to an income threshold  defined using 1992 expenditure data  below which economic families or persons not in economic families would likely have devoted a larger share of their after-tax income than average to the necessities of food  shelter and clothing. More specifically  the thresholds represented income levels at which these families or persons were expected to spend 20 percentage points or more of their after-tax income than average on food  shelter and clothing. These thresholds have been adjusted to current dollars using the all-items Consumer Price Index (CPI).
,The LICO-AT has 35 cut-offs varying by seven family sizes and five different sizes of area of residence to account for economies of scale and potential differences in cost of living in communities of different sizes. These thresholds are presented in Table 4.3 Low-income cut-offs  after tax (LICO-AT - 1992 base) for economic families and persons not in economic families  2015  Dictionary  Census of Population  2016.
,When the after-tax income of an economic family member or a person not in an economic family falls below the threshold applicable to the person  the person is considered to be in low income according to LICO-AT. Since the LICO-AT threshold and family income are unique within each economic family  low-income status based on LICO-AT can also be reported for economic families.
,Prevalence of low income - The proportion or percentage of units whose income falls below a specified low-income line.

130, Tenure - Refers to whether the household owns or rents their private dwelling. The private dwelling may be situated on rented or leased land or be part of a condominium. A household is considered to own their dwelling if some member of the household owns the dwelling even if it is not fully paid for  for example if there is a mortgage or some other claim on it. A household is considered to rent their dwelling if no member of the household owns the dwelling. A household is considered to rent that dwelling even if the dwelling is provided without cash rent or at a reduced rent  or if the dwelling is part of a cooperative.
,For historical and statutory reasons  shelter occupancy on Indian reserves or settlements does not lend itself to the usual classification by standard tenure categories. Therefore  a special category  band housing  has been created and is included in the classification of tenure.
131, Condominium status - Refers to whether the private dwelling is part of a condominium development. A condominium is a residential complex in which dwellings are owned individually while land and common elements are held in joint ownership with others.
132, Bedrooms - Refers to rooms in a private dwelling that are designed mainly for sleeping purposes even if they are now used for other purposes  such as guest rooms and television rooms. Also included are rooms used as bedrooms now  even if they were not originally built as bedrooms  such as bedrooms in a finished basement. Bedrooms exclude rooms designed for another use during the day such as dining rooms and living rooms even if they may be used for sleeping purposes at night. By definition  one-room private dwellings such as bachelor or studio apartments have zero bedrooms.
133, Rooms - Refers to enclosed areas within a private dwelling which are finished and suitable for year-round living. The number of rooms of a private dwelling includes kitchens  bedrooms and finished rooms in the attic or basement. The number of rooms of a private dwelling excludes bathrooms  halls  vestibules and rooms used solely for business purposes. Partially divided rooms are considered to be separate rooms if they are considered as such by the respondent (e.g.  L-shaped dining-room and living-room arrangements).
134, Persons per room - Refers to an indicator of the level of crowding in a private dwelling. It is calculated by dividing the number of persons in the household by the number of rooms in the dwelling.
135, Housing suitability - Refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is  whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms  as calculated using the NOS.
,Housing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies.
136, Period of construction - Refers to the period in time during which the building or dwelling was originally constructed. This refers to the period in which the building was completed  not the time of any later remodelling  additions or conversions.
137, Includes data up to May 10  2016.
138, Dwelling condition - Refers to whether the dwelling is in need of repairs. This does not include desirable remodelling or additions.
139, Number of household maintainers - Refers to the number of persons of the same household who have been identified as household maintainers.
,A household maintainer is a person residing in the household who is responsible for paying the rent  or the mortgage  or the taxes  or the electricity or other services or utilities. Where a number of people may contribute to the payments  more than one person in the household may be identified as a household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making any such payments  the first person listed is selected by default.
140, Primary household maintainer - The first person in the household identified as someone who pays the rent  or the mortgage  or the taxes  or the electricity or other services or utilities for the dwelling. When more than one member of the household contributes to the payments  the first person listed is chosen as the primary household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making any such payments  the first person listed is selected by default.
,The order of the persons in a household is determined by the order in which they are listed on the questionnaire. Generally  an adult is listed first followed  if applicable  by their spouse or common-law partner and then by their children. The order does not necessarily correspond to the proportion of household payments made by each person.
141, Shelter-cost-to-income ratio - Refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs.
,Shelter-cost-to-income ratio is calculated for private households living in owned or rented dwellings who reported a total household income greater than zero.
,Private households living in band housing  located on an agricultural operation that is operated by a member of the household  and households who reported a zero or negative total household income are excluded.
,The relatively high shelter-costs-to-household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2016  while household total income is reported for the year 2015. As well  for some households  the 2015 household total income may represent income for only part of a year.
,For more information on household total income or shelter costs  refer to the Census Dictionary: Total income and Shelter cost.
142, Presence of mortgage payments - Refers to whether an owner household makes regular mortgage or loan payments for their dwelling.
143, Shelter cost refers to the average monthly total of all shelter expenses paid by households that own or rent their dwelling.

For renter households  shelter costs include  where applicable  the rent and the costs of electricity  heat  water and other municipal services.
144, Value (owner estimated) of private dwelling - Refers to the dollar amount expected by the owner if the asset were to be sold.
,In the context of dwelling  it refers to the value of the entire dwelling  including the value of the land it is on and of any other structure  such as a garage  which is on the property. If the dwelling is located in a building which contains several dwellings  or a combination of residential and business premises  all of which the household owns  the value is estimated as a portion of the market value that applies only to the dwelling in which the household resides.
145, Subsidized housing - Refers to whether the dwelling is subsidized. Subsidized housing includes rent geared to income  social housing  public housing  government-assisted housing  non-profit housing  rent supplements and housing allowances.
146, Highest certificate  diploma or degree is the classification used in the census to measure the broader concept of 'Educational attainment.'
,This variable refers to the highest level of education that a person has successfully completed and is derived from the educational qualifications questions  which asked for all certificates  diplomas and degrees to be reported.
,The general hierarchy used in deriving this variable (high school  trades  college  university) is loosely tied to the 'in-class' duration of the various types of education. At the detailed level  someone who has completed one type of certificate  diploma or degree will not necessarily have completed the credentials listed below it in the hierarchy. For example  a person with an apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma may not have completed a high school certificate or diploma  nor does an individual with a 'master's degree' necessarily have a 'certificate or diploma above bachelor level.' Although the hierarchy may not fit all programs perfectly  it gives a general measure of educational attainment.
,This variable is reported for persons aged 15 years and over in private households.
,Users are advised to consult data quality comments for 'Highest certificate  diploma or degree'  available in the Education Reference Guide  Census of Population  2016  Catalogue no. 98-500-X2016013.

151, 'Field of study' refers to the discipline or area of learning/training associated with a particular course or programme of study.
,This variable refers to the predominant discipline or area of learning or training of a person's highest completed postsecondary certificate  diploma or degree  classified according to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Canada 2016.
,This 'Major field of study' variable can be used either independently or in conjunction with the 'Highest certificate  diploma or degree' variable. When the latter is used with 'Major field of study ' it should be noted that different fields of study will be more common for different types of postsecondary qualifications. At the detailed program level  some programs are only offered by certain types of institutions.
,There was an explicit instruction in the questionnaire which instructed respondents to be as specific as possible in indicating a subfield or subcategory of specialization within a broad discipline or area of training.
,This variable is reported for persons aged 15 years and over in private households.
,This variable shows the 'Variant of CIP 2016 - Alternative primary groupings' CIP variant  with the hierarchy of the primary groupings and two-digit series. When a primary grouping contains more than one subseries from series '30. Multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary studies ' these subseries are grouped together. An exception is made for '30.01 Biological and physical sciences' due to its large size. For more information on the CIP classification  see the Classification of Instructional Programs  Canada 2016.
,For information on collection  classification and data quality for this variable  refer to the Education Reference Guide  Census of Population  2016  Catalogue no. 98-500-X2016013.
,Certain series and their subcomponents are not used when coding major field of study for the census. These are series 21  32 to 37 and 53  which represent non-credit and personal improvement fields of study.
152, 'No postsecondary certificate  diploma or degree' includes persons who have not completed an apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma; a college  CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma; or a university certificate  diploma or degree.
153, 'Interdisciplinary humanities' includes '30.13 Medieval and renaissance studies ' '30.21 Holocaust and related studies ' '30.22 Classical and ancient studies' and '30.29 Maritime studies.'
154, 'Interdisciplinary social and behavioural sciences' includes '30.05 Peace studies and conflict resolution ' '30.10 Biopsychology ' '30.11 Gerontology ' '30.14 Museology/museum studies ' '30.15 Science  technology and society ' '30.17 Behavioural sciences ' '30.20 International/global studies ' '30.23 Intercultural/multicultural and diversity studies ' '30.25 Cognitive science ' '30.26 Cultural studies/critical theory and analysis ' '30.28 Dispute resolution ' '30.31 Human computer interaction' and '30.33 Sustainability studies.'

,    *the province  territory or country of the institution from which a person obtained a certificate  diploma or degree  or;
,    *the province  territory or country of the institution that a person attended during a specified reference period  or for a specific level of education.
,In both cases  location of study refers to the location of the institution granting the certificate  diploma or degree  not the location of the person at the time he or she obtained the qualification or was attending the institution. The geographic location is specified according to boundaries current at the time the data are collected  not the boundaries at the time of study.
,This is a summary variable that indicates whether the 'Location of study' of the person's highest certificate  diploma or degree was the same province or territory where the person lived at the time of the 2016 Census of Population  a different Canadian province or territory  or outside Canada. This variable is derived from 'Location of study' and 'Province or territory of current residence.' It only applies to individuals who had completed a postsecondary certificate  diploma or degree.
,'Location of study outside Canada' may be further sub-classified using the Standard Classification of Countries and Areas of Interest (SCCAI). When using the SCCAI for this sub-classification  the class 'Canada' is not used.
,This variable is reported for persons aged 15 years and over in private households.
,For information on collection  classification and data quality for 'Location of study compared with province or territory of residence ' refer to the Education Reference Guide  Census of Population  2016  Catalogue no. 98-500-X2016013.

175, The census assumes that the commute to work originates from the usual place of residence  but this may not always be the case. Sometimes  respondents may be on a business trip and may have reported their place of work or main mode of commuting based on where they were working during the trip. Some persons maintain a residence close to work and commute to their home on weekends. Students often work after school at a location near their school. As a result  the data may show unusual commutes or unusual main modes of commuting.
